&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license forsoftware and other kinds of works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designedto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom toshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains freesoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use theGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also toany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it toyour programs, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if youwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in newfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying youthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you havecertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or ifyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whethergratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the samefreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receiveor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so theyknow their rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this Licensegiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explainsthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' andauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked aschanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously toauthors of previous versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or runmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturercan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim ofprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematicpattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals touse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, wehave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for thoseproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, westand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versionsof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.States should not allow patents to restrict development and use ofsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish toavoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program couldmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures thatpatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.&lt;/p>

Each licensee is addressed as âyouâ.  âLicenseesâ andârecipientsâ may be individuals or organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">To âmodifyâ a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the workin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of anexact copy.  The resulting work is called a âmodified versionâ of theearlier work or a work âbased onâ the earlier work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">A âcovered workâ means either the unmodified Program or a work basedon the Program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">To âpropagateâ a work means to do anything with it that, withoutpermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable forinfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on acomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,distribution (with or without modification), making available to thepublic, and in some countries other activities as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">To âconveyâ a work means any kind of propagation that enables otherparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user througha computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">An interactive user interface displays âAppropriate Legal Noticesâto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visiblefeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to theextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey thework under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  Ifthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as amenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">A âStandard Interfaceâ means an interface that either is an officialstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case ofinterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one thatis widely used among developers working in that language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">The âSystem Librariesâ of an executable work include anything, otherthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form ofpackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that MajorComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with thatMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which animplementation is available to the public in source code form.  AâMajor Componentâ, in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used toproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">The âCorresponding Sourceâ for a work in object code form means allthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executablework) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts tocontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work'sSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available freeprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities butwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Sourceincludes interface definition files associated with source files forthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamicallylinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,such as by intimate data communication or control flow between thosesubprograms and other parts of the work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that userscan regenerate automatically from other parts of the CorrespondingSource.&lt;/p>

This    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,    regardless of how they are packaged.

&lt;li style=" font-size:8pt;" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li style=" font-size:8pt;" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord    with subsection 6b.&lt;/li>
&lt;li style=" font-size:8pt;" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li style=" font-size:8pt;" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no    charge under subsection 6d.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>

In determining whether a product is a consumer product,doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particularproduct received by a particular user, ânormally usedâ refers to atypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the statusof the particular user or of the way in which the particular useractually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A productis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantialcommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses representthe only significant mode of use of the product.&lt;/p>

Ancillary propagation of a covered workoccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmissionto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate ormodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you donot accept this License.

&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">A patent license is âdiscriminatoryâ if it does not include withinthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or isconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that arespecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a coveredwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that isin the business of distributing software, under which you make paymentto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveyingthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of theparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatorypatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered workconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarilyfor and in connection with specific products or compilations thatcontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey acovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you maynot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate youto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you conveythe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you havepermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensedunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a singlecombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of thisLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to thecombination as such.&lt;/p>

Such new versions willbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail toaddress new problems or concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If theProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU GeneralPublic License âor any later versionâ applies to it, you have theoption of following the terms and conditions either of that numberedversion or of any later version published by the Free SoftwareFoundation.

&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which futureversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy'spublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes youto choose that version for the Program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style=" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:8pt;">Later license versions may give you additional or differentpermissions.
